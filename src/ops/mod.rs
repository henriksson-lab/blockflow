// Original work for this crate. Written from the definitions of the operations,
// not adapted from any implementation of them.
//
// The first ops in this crate that move real data. Until now `probes` held the
// only implementations of `BlockOp`, and they exist to prove the *framework* —
// an identity whose expected output is its input, a window sum that diverges
// when the halo is short. Those are still the right tools for that job. What
// they cannot do is be used, and this module is what a caller composes a chain
// out of.
//
// Five families, and what each contributes beyond its arithmetic
// --------------------------------------------------------------
// | module | ops | what it makes expressible |
// |---|---|---|
// | `voxelwise` | a general map, and the connectives over two inputs | the **sink of a diamond**: reach 0, two operands, which nothing here could express |
// | `rank` | an order statistic of a neighbourhood, the median included | a reach derived from a filter size, and a constant algebra that is exact rather than approximate |
// | `morphology` | erode, dilate, open, close | a reach that is **twice** the element, because two of the four are compositions |
// | `local` | windowed mean, deviation and rank on a sample lattice | a reach with **two terms**, and the globally anchored lattice that makes it decomposition-invariant at all |
// | `local` | thresholding against a local statistic | a threshold that varies with position, and inherits every property above |
//
// The shape every op in here has, and why
// ---------------------------------------
// Each operation is a **free function generic over the element type as far as
// the algorithm allows** — a rank filter over `Ord`, morphology over `bool`, a
// comparison over `PartialOrd`, a voxelwise map over nothing at all — with a
// thin `BlockOp` implementation on top that adapts the buffer it is handed to
// it.
//
// That split is not stylistic, and it has now been cashed in. Change 5 of
// `docs/design/BLOCK_OPS.md` §"The combined pass" made the element type a tag
// (`voxels::Voxels`) and the rank 3; it rewrote every adapter in this module and
// **changed no kernel body**. What each adapter does now is one `match` on the
// tag: a `bool` volume reaches `erode_into` with no conversion and no copy,
// where before it was widened to `f64` and narrowed back at 8x the bytes.
//
// What an adapter still declares
// ------------------------------
// `accepts` and `produces` say which element types the shell can bridge — not
// which ones the *kernel* could take. `rank_filter_into` is generic over `Ord`,
// so its shell accepts every integer and both floats; `local_statistic_into` is
// generic over `Copy` with an `f64` accumulator, but `LocalStatistic::
// evaluate_into` is stated in `f64` and widening *that* is kernel work rather
// than shell work, so its shell accepts `f64` and says so here rather than
// pretending otherwise.
//
// Three rules this module holds itself to
// ---------------------------------------
// **`reach` is derived from the parameters and there is no field that sets
// it.** An element of size 7 reaches 3; an opening over it reaches 6; a
// statistic on a lattice of spacing `s` reaches `s` further than its window.
// Every one of those is computed from the parameter it follows from, in the same
// type that holds the parameter. The design's warning is explicit — a reach fed
// by the configured halo makes the guard compare a number against itself — and
// the way to be sure of that is to have nothing to feed it with.
//
// **`constant_maps_to` is declared only where it is exactly true.** The default
// is `None` and an op that says nothing is never skipped, so silence is safe and
// a wrong declaration is not. That is why the local *mean* declares nothing
// except at zero: `(v + v + ... + v) / m` is not `v` in binary floating point,
// and a block that was skipped would differ from a block that was computed in
// the last bit. A rank statistic selects a value that was read and therefore is
// exact, and says so.
//
// **Edge behaviour is defined, and it is defined at the volume boundary.** Every
// neighbourhood here is clamped to the array it is handed. At a real volume
// boundary that is the whole story: there is nothing beyond to read, and the
// whole-volume reference clamps identically. At a block seam the clamp is
// *wrong*, deliberately, because a silent wrong answer is what the halo guard
// exists to convert into a loud one.
//
// Costs
// -----
// See `COST_MEASUREMENT`. Every `cost_per_voxel` in this module is a
// measurement, taken by `ops::cost::measure`, which is runnable.

/// How the costs in this module were obtained, and what they are relative to.
///
/// `BlockOp::cost_per_voxel` says it must be measured rather than guessed, and
/// `docs/design/BLOCK_OPS.md` is blunt about why: the search returns the optimum
/// for whatever model it is given, and it is the model rather than the search
/// that has been wrong here before.
///
/// **Method.** `ops::cost::measure` runs each op over a fixed volume through the
/// same `BlockOp::apply` the executor calls, takes the best of several
/// repetitions — the contamination on a shared machine is one-sided, so a
/// minimum is the robust statistic and a mean is worthless — and divides by the
/// voxel count. The numbers are then expressed **relative to the voxelwise map**,
/// which is the cheapest thing in the module and is therefore the natural unit:
/// `1.0` means "one voxelwise map's worth of work per voxel", which is also what
/// the trait's default of `1.0` claims. `CostModel::read_cost_per_voxel` and
/// `write_cost_per_voxel` default to the same `1.0`, so a cost of `n` here says
/// this op costs about as much as `n` reads.
///
/// **What is measured and what is a shape.** The per-voxel figure for a
/// neighbourhood op depends on the element, so what is measured is the cost *per
/// element voxel* and the op multiplies by its own element size; a 27-voxel
/// median and a 343-voxel median are not one number. The same for a lattice: the
/// window cost is divided by the samples per voxel, and the interpolation is
/// charged flat.
///
/// **Where these were taken.** On the machine this crate was developed on, with
/// `--release`, one thread, over a 96 x 64 x 64 volume; `ops::cost::report`
/// prints the table and is the way to retake them somewhere else. They are
/// *ratios*, which is what the planner uses them for and what survives a change
/// of machine better than any absolute figure — `docs/design/BLOCK_OPS.md`
/// §"Simulating strategies": trust "A beats B", distrust "A takes 40 minutes".
